# naive-stateful-app

(I've taken some inspiration from this blog post)[https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/11/react-redux-history-implementation/]

I wanted to make a naive store akin to Redux - and be able to use and update it by making my own components

## Installation

`npm i`

## Usage

Currently the best approach is run `node --experimental-modules ./src/`.

If you must see a broken app run `npm start`
